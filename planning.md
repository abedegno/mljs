   - ? Widgets: Data explorer widget: Need to ensure arrows are drawn behind boxes z-order
   - ? Widgets: Data explorer widget: Need to set end points for existing boxes to edge most in line with startpoint to centre of box, but finishing outside the box

   8. Loading triples with MLJS. How to use a simple JSON structure to load standalone facts.
   9. Configuring an ontology to power Semantic Queries with Sparql. How to customise a sparql query bar widget, and create a subject browsing page
 - New 1.5 (Mar 2014) Interim targets
  - CSS best practice
   - Use variables where it makes sense (title height, padding, etc.)
   - minimise property name length and collisions with other css by using ``.mljswidget .docproperties {  .title {}  .name {} ... }`` style of CSS declarations
   - Rejig H tags to be at a lower level (searchresults h5, subtitle h4, title h3) - leaves space for page title (h1) and panel/tab title (h2), and extra in widget title. E.g. search property value (h6)
   - IN PROGRESS create generic classes for all widgets
    - DONE title
    - subtitle
    - listtitle (E.g. for search results, sparql subjects, other dynamically drawn h4 type tags)
    - highlight
    - selected
  - JavaScript best practices / conventions
   - IN PROGRESS use var max = whatever.length in for loops - between 2 and 150 times faster than accessing the DOM on each iteration
    - DONE Sparql (triple) widgets
    - Search widgets
    - Core
    - Highcharts
   - underscores for private functions
   - NA _configuration json object for Workplace compatible widgets/contexts
   - UpperCamelCase for constructors/objects
   - IN PROGRESS lowerCamelCase for functions (searchcontext and mljs have some alllowercase methods)
   - DONE Using Factory pattern. See mljs.create*() methods. Changed mljs.defaultconnection in core MLJS to instead access parent MLJS instance
   - DONE Using logger mixin. Logger's attached to DB, so have had to link tripleconfig to creating db via factory method. keep tripleconfig separate from core MLJS instantiator (as it never requires a connection to use), but allow a way to specify a logger and check for this (to avoid defaultconnection.logger)
   - DONE better way to access logging functionality by default - define _i(), _d() prototype methods for each subobject? Via a core mixin utility func? 
    - DONE (Could use same mechanism to provide correct 'this' reference from constructor function.)
    - DONE Using mljs.create*() factory methods. Have mljs.prototype. constructor functions add a db property pointer to all created children
   - NA Using factory pattern instead. Add check in constructor functions to ensure if not called via new MyObject(), that it returns a new instance anyway (location 1051)
   - Double check isArray function definition for best practice (location 1110) - also check for splice()
   - IN PROGRESS Done this for tripleconfig, not widgets and their contexts. Use self defining functions for lazy loading (E.g. semantic context creation), and any requiring extensive initialisation (Sparql widget?) (location 1515)
   - Memoization (cache) pattern applied to sparql facts (location 1702)
   - Apply Currying when calling the same function with mostly same parameters (if costly) (location 1860)
   - Use Module pattern and closures to hide internal properties/private methods (location 2117) but with constructors (2139)
   - DONE using for logging mixin on context objects. Apply Borrow and Bind pattern (mixin for functions) where applicable (to avoid any inheritance temptations) (location 2922)
   - Apply Data Validation pattern to 'create' widget (When new functionality added - may be V 1.2?) (location 3254)
   - Find a better way to restrict what parts of the logging output are set to use debug (Perhaps a mixin to objects with lazy initialisation based on debug level specified, if any)

   - Others?
  - Core: Complete support for /v1/values REST function (suggestions aka auto complete etc)
  - Test: Support current functionality against MarkLogic V7
  - Core: New V7 functionality
   - Core: Multipart/mime support - required for POST search, but also useful generically. May require some additional core work
   - Core: POST /v1/search - Dynamic search options (Try this in search context, catch error if on V6 and fall back to original mode)
   - Core: Alerting
   - Core: Score-function=linear|reciprocal, scale-factor=0|inputFloat

   - NA Doesn't make sense - all handled internally by workplacecontext: getWidget by name (so you can programmatically add settings after load)
   - DONE getWorkplaceContext (could be done via widget optionally too)
   - NA done in real time (run til complete): addLoadedListener (so you can programmatically add settings after load)

    - Allow fallback to be set programmatically or via app wide settings
  - DONE Create WorkplaceContext object in workplace js file
   - DONE updatePage event - occurs when a page is loaded. E.g. from current page URL or for current logged in user or as fallback
